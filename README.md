#Boson - An experimental editor
Boson is a minimalistic experimental source code editor. It's written in Node, and wrapped in
Nw.js as a runtime container for easy cross-platform integration.

It utilizes Codemirror in place for it's source view highlighting and editing.

##Keeping things simple
Boson aims to give you a minimal core. Further functionality can be added with
user level plugins.

##Pre-built binaries
We have pre-built binaries for Linux and Windows. OSX users need to clone our
repository and manually download nw.js. (It would be great to have a
contributer to tackle OSX).

_Take note: - this is experimental software._
