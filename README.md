#Boson - An experimental editor
Boson is an experimental editor built primarily for web development. It's written in NodeJS, and wrapped in
Nw.js as a runtime container for easy cross-platform integration.

Boson is still very experimental and should not be considered even close to stable - it's just fun to poke around
in.

##Why not use brackets or atom?
While brackets and atom are __awesome__, they do have a few performance issues and tend to run slowly. In
my line of work, they also pack __too many__ features for me to feel comfortable.
