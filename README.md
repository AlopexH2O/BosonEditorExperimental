#Boson - An experimental editor
Boson is a minimalistic experimental source code editor. It's written in Node, and wrapped in
Nw.js as a runtime container for easy cross-platform integration.

It utilizes Codemirror in place for it's source view highlighting and editing.

##Keeping things simple
Boson aims to give you a minimal core. Further functionality can be added with
user level plugins.
